# Shuffle

Shuffle lines quickly

**Before**
```
apple banana cherry
```

`:Shuffle 2 3 1`

**After**
```
banana cherry apple
```

#

Also works with custom delimiters, the default delimiter is a space.

**Before**
```
apple,banana,cherry
```

`:Shuffle 2 3 1 ,`

**After**
```
banana,cherry,apple
```

# Visual mode shuffling (VShuffle)

When you want to get it done quickly, select the lines with uppercase `V`, then

**Before**
```
apple : 1
banana : 2
cherry : 3
```

`:VShuffle 3 2 1`

**After**
```
1 : apple
2 : banana
3 : cherry
```

It also allows quick duplication, which will help you produce garbage code at
lightning speed.

**Before**
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

`:VShuffle 1 1`

**After**
```
apple apple
banana banana
cherry cherry
```

# But typing `:VShuffle` is not fast

Personally I have the following keybinds in my nvim configuration. Mapping the
capital letter S to VShuffle and the capital letter X to VReverse. Keybindings
are not enforced, so you will have to set your own.

```vim
vn S :VShuffle<space>
vn X :VReverse<space>
```

## Extra help

There is a small window available that updates as you look around. It can also
be used to specify a temporary delimiter other than the default separator. For
instance `:SShow ,` will both pop-up a little view to preview which index
corresponds to which token, as well as change the temporary delimiter. To
remove the temporary delimiter in favour of the default separator, simply call
`:SResetDelimiter`.  To hide the visual aid, simply call `:SHide`.

```vim
nn <space>s :SShow<CR>
nn <space>h :SHide<CR>
```

## But we already have regular expressions

True.

You could make some interesting remaps to do something similar.
For instance, you could also add to your init.vim:

```vim
set incsearch
set inccommand=nosplit

cno S \(\S\+\)
```

Where you could use the `S` to type `'<,'>:s~S S S~\2 \3 \1~` on a visual
selection to achieve the same result.
But hitting a key for every column you want to consider, as well as the
separators (`~`) and the matching groups `\2 \3 \1` is all just a little
uncomfortable. Of course, for slightly more complicated shuffling the regex
substitutions will always be there for you ðŸ’ž.

### Setup

Shuffle uses the default `=` to reindent lines it touches.  If you want to
disable this behaviour, just set `gveq` to false in your Lua configuration.
The following is what the configuration looks like with the current defaults.
These defaults can also be seen in [settings.lua](lua/shuffle/settings.lua).

```lua
require('shuffle').setup{
  -- Functional settings
  separator = " ",
  gveq = false,

  -- Window options (aesthetics)
  window_full_screen = false,
  window_width = 30,
  window_height = 30,
  window_opacity = 0,
  window_style = 'minimal',
  window_border = 'single',
  window_relative = 'win',
  window_col = 1,
  window_row = 1,
}
```
